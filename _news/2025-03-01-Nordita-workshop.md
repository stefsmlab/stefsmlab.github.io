when: Mar 2023
what: I'm very happy to meet with the statistical physics community of the Nordic countries at the <a href="https://indico.fysik.su.se/event/8942/overview" target="_blank">Nordic Workshop on Statistical Physics</a>. I'll talk about how StatPhys tools can shed lights on ML problems and in particular about how we can understand bias generation and amplification in ML.
