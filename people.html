<p>
  I am a <b>senior postdoctoral fellow</b> at Gatsby and SWC (University College London) working with Andrew Saxe. 
  Prior to my current position, I held a postdoctoral position at the University of Oxford (still with Andrew Saxe) and obtained a Ph.D. in Physics applied to Machine Learning at the University of Paris-Saclay supervised by Lenka Zdeborova. 
  My research focuses on analyzing machine learning problems using a model-based approach, where the complexity of the problem is reduced to obtain a parsimonious solvable model that still captures the phenomenon of interest. 
  In my previous works, I applied several variations of this approach to study problems in learning, such as transfer learning, continual learning, and curriculum learning.
