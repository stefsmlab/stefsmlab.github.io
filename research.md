# Research Directions
- Bias generation and amplification in ML systems. What is behind biases in an ML system? What is the impact of our design choices?
- Learning differences in biological and artificial neural networks. Curriculum learning, continual learning, transfer learning, same concept but completely different results in animals and machines, why?
- Optimisation in rough landscapes. Connecting dynamics and landscape properties in optimisation.
